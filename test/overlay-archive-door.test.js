/**
 * `IS THAT A LOT?` — THE ARCHIVE DOOR OVER THE RINK.
 *
 * Kevin, 2026-09-25: *"It takes 3 or 4 mouse clicks to get to 'how we counted
 * this' from a replay-layer and it takes us away from the replay page."* And
 * 2026-09-26: *"I want both is that a lot and how we counted to overlay the
 * rink, same space, different overlays."*
 *
 * ⛔⛔⛔ THE DEFECT THIS FILE EXISTS FOR, AND I SHIPPED IT INTO THE TREE. The
 * panel was built against `printed.js` alone. Four of the seven layer doors land
 * on the OTHER kind of figure — one whose numerator and denominator are prose in
 * `derivation.js` — so opening the overlay on the Control layer put that layer's
 * name in the heading and drew an empty body. Every test passed. It was found by
 * opening the page in a browser and looking at it.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ THE ROOT CAUSE WAS A NOTE WRITTEN FROM THE DOORS' NAMES rather than from
 * what renders them: `memory/work-door-over-the-rink.md` said "the layer's `work`
 * sections, one to three", which is true and says nothing about there being two
 * renderers. So the check below is not "the overlay works"; it is the INVARIANT
 * whose violation produced the empty panel — every anchor a layer's door names
 * is answered by one of the two tables. That is checkable without a browser and
 * fails the day a seventh door is added to a table that does not exist yet.
